TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.368 ns between insta_display/monedero_int_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and insta_display/decenas_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.371 ns between insta_display/monedero_int_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and insta_display/decenas_reg[6]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.372 ns between insta_display/monedero_int_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and insta_display/decenas_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
